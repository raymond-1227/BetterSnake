# Better Snake

## About
The original one is pretty nice, but I'm making the game with a nice looking HTML site, and making it endless. (the original one could end if you collide into the walls or the snake itself)

## Play the Game

## Troubleshooting
  - The snake is gone
    - Try doing [Up/Down] or [Left/Right], it should appear since the snake was outside of the box.
