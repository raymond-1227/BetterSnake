# Better Snake

Wow, I just made it worse! YAY!!!!!111!!!

---

## About
The original one is pretty nice, but I'm making the game with a nice looking HTML site, and making it endless. (the original one could end if you collide into the walls or the snake itself)

## Play the Game

## Source Code

Please [click here](https://github.com/raymond-1227/better-snake) for the source code.

## Troubleshooting
  - The snake is gone
    - Try doing [Up/Down] or [Left/Right], it should appear since the snake was outside of the box.
